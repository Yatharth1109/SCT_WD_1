README: My Awesome Portfolio!
Hey there! So, this is my brand-new online portfolio. I just finished putting it together, and it's basically my digital space to show off the cool stuff I've been working on and what I'm learning as a student.
My goal with this project is to create a central spot where people can see my projects, understand my skills, and get in touch with me. I'm really hoping this helps me connect with opportunities, whether it's for internships or future jobs.
Want to See It Live? Here's How!
If you're curious about how this portfolio looks and works.
Since this portfolio is built as a static website (mostly HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript), you don't need any complex setup. You can literally just open the index.html file directly in your web browser.
Just navigate to the folder you just cloned, find index.html, and double-click it. Your default web browser should open it right up!
What's Inside?
I've kept the structure pretty simple and clear so it's easy to navigate:
 * Home Page: A brief introduction to who I am and what I'm passionate about.
 * Projects Section: This is where I'll be showcasing my various projects. It might start with a few, but I'll be updating it regularly as I complete more work.
 * Skills Section: A quick overview of the programming languages, tools, and technologies I'm proficient in.
 * Contact Information: Details on how to reach me, whether it's for collaboration or just to say hello!
That's pretty much it for my portfolio! I'm excited to share my work, and I hope you find it interesting. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to let me know!
